# AppliedMathLearning
Just a repo I will use for learning math by applying it with "experiments"


Going through the exercises in the book _Physically Based Rendering Theory_
https://pbrt.org/

exists exercises that have you implement programs for applied mathematics. I will just keep this repo dedicated for myself to learn more math.
