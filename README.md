# AppliedMathLearning
Just a repo I will use for learning math by applying it with "experiments"


Going through the exercises in the book _Physically Based Rendering Theory_
https://pbrt.org/

exists exercises that have you implement programs for applied mathematics. I will just keep this repo dedicated for myself to learn more math. 

TODO:

1) Reorganize the project structure a bit so that experiments are organized in a single
directory, rather than being on the same level as the main library
2) Maybe organize src & test in to their own directory(where functionality exists for other
downstream experiments depend on)
